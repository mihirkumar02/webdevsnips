## Firebase Authentication Demo; Part of my webdevsnips Instagram page
This folder contains code for demonstrating how to perform basic User Authentication using Email and Password in Firebase. Although it is meant for beginners, experienced devs can use it as a refresher.

### Features
  - Login
  - SignUp
  - Forgot Password

### Live Demo
Find the live demo of this code right [here](https://authentication-bcd53.web.app/).

### It's Your Turn Now!
To get started, 
1. Clone the repository files onto your system.
2. Store them in a new folder.
3. Run index.html on a live server from any code editor (I suggest VS Code).
4. You should see the Login page.

### That's it! Now the code is yours to play with!

I will be adding a Google and Facebook Login method soon in the same repository. Stay Tuned! 

#### For any collaborations, feel free to contact me :grin:
